# Handover

Where things stand as of **2026-09-16**, for whoever picks this up — person or unattended run.
One page on purpose. `docs/PROCESS.md` is how to work; this is what is true right now.

**Check it against git before trusting it.** The version of this page dated 2026-09-14 said
"next epic: EPIC-032" for two days after EPIC-032 shipped, and a session started on it would have
rebuilt a finished epic. `git log --oneline -15`, `ls docs/epics/reports/`, and the `/healthz` of
both environments take a minute and are the truth.

## Start here

**Next epic: EPIC-041** — the Versions page: history, restore, A/B on one input set.

**It has no epic file yet.** `docs/AUTONOMOUS.md` says an unwritten row stops the loop;
`docs/PROCESS.md`'s amendment of 2026-09-15 — the newer of the two — says Claude Code writes the
file itself when no advisor is relaying, and EPIC-040 was written that way on 2026-09-16. The row is
fully scoped in `docs/roadmap.md` (Goal, Tasks, Tests, Review) and needs nobody but the implementer,
so write the file and build it. The reasoning is in `docs/decisions/AUTONOMOUS.md`.

**What EPIC-041 inherits from EPIC-040**, all three in its report §11 rather than only here:

1. **A version that fails to record is a silent gap.** `recordVersionNow` never throws and never
   blocks a save. If an incomplete history should be visible to a person, the Versions page is where
   that lives — it is a product decision and Soroush has not made it.
2. **`suite_runs.version` is nullable and stays nullable.** Every run predating EPIC-040 has none,
   and backfilling would invent a historical fact. The page will meet those runs and must say
   something honest about them.
3. **Nothing prunes.** 50 versions is ~2 MiB per prompt and `versionsForPrompt` defaults to 50.
   Deleting somebody's history is a product decision, not an implementation detail.

## Stages

| stage | state |
|---|---|
| Stage 0–2 | **done.** Every epic has a report and a session log. |
| Stage 3 | **done.** 030 ✅ · 031 ✅ · 031a ✅ · 032 ✅ · 033 ✅ · 034 ✅ |
| **GATE 3** | **decided 2026-09-16** — `docs/decisions/GATE-3.md`. Go for Stage 4; **loud launch deferred**. |
| **Stage 4** | **in progress.** 040 ✅ · 041 next · 043, 042 todo |
| Stage 5+ | untouched. GATE 5 sits after EPIC-055. |

**EPIC-035 (loud launch) is behind the gate and stays `todo`.** It is not `cut`. Soroush deferred it
until the judge has run against a real model and the rule-6 question is answered.

## The first real model call happened

**2026-09-16, EPIC-031a.** Two calls to `claude-sonnet-5` from deployed staging through the Runs
page. **$0.02**, 59 in / 607 out tokens, 3.8s and 8.4s. Before that date every run in every test,
screenshot and drive was answered by a fake.

It found what it was built to find: **`result.response?.body` came back undefined**, so rule 6's
"raw provider payload" was the SDK's normalised view and **the resolved model id was never
captured**. Fixed in `ca70def` without pretending the body was obtained — `modelId` is captured and
the fallback labels itself `normalised: true`.

## Open, and who owns it

| what | owner |
|---|---|
| **EPIC-031a's three unticked criteria** — the resolved model id, a cached repeat at zero, one real judge call. **All three are now drivable**: staging has the code since the 2026-09-16 push. About thirty minutes. | next session, or Soroush |
| **Does a normalised view satisfy rule 6?** The privacy page describes that retention to users. Obtaining the real body means a `fetch` wrapper. **Cheaper to answer before EPIC-042** puts two more providers behind the same adapter. | Soroush |
| **A release is due.** Production is at `af089c7`, 79+ commits behind; newest tag `v0.5.0`. `docs/epics/RELEASE-DUE.md` has the list, generated at `f3fa8a2` and now stale. | Soroush |
| **`privacy@41prompts.ai` must exist.** Both legal pages name it. A Cloudflare routing rule, not code. | Soroush |
| **EPIC-006b/c/d** — Stage 0 debt, all unscheduled: the ~25s deploy gap, the public Coolify hostname, staging and production sharing one R2 prefix. | unscheduled |
| **EPIC-006, EPIC-090, EPIC-071** — `deferred`, each waiting on something only Soroush can do. | Soroush |

## Where the code is

Measured 2026-09-16, against `/healthz` rather than remembered:

| | commit | |
|---|---|---|
| local `main` | `1a63b9a` | EPIC-040 merged |
| `origin/main` / staging | `da42eee` | 3 behind |
| production | `af089c7` | 79+ behind; only a `v*` tag moves it |

## Process, as it currently stands

- **Nothing is pushed. Soroush pushes.** `CLAUDE.md`'s rule, and it stands. He asked for one push by
  hand on 2026-09-16 and confirmed in the same breath that it was a one-off and the rule does not
  change. **Do not push on your own initiative, and do not edit the rule.**
- **`node scripts/gates.mjs ci` is the only CI there is** for anything not yet pushed. Run it on the
  commit, before the merge. Read its closing "what a green here still does not cover" block — it is
  part of the result.
- **`main` moves by `git merge --no-ff` from a branch**, and the merge message carries what a PR
  description carried.
- **The browser drive is a Definition-of-Done item**, against the **built** app — `turbo run build`,
  then `next start`. Never `pnpm dev`.

## Five things recent epics cost, worth not relearning

1. **A helper that normalises state hides the defect from every test that uses it.** `PROCESS.md`
   has the rule and the three instances.
2. **A cleanup that always runs last will eventually delete the thing the run was for.** EPIC-031a's
   drive cascaded away its own evidence and the call had to be paid for twice. Verify, then tidy.
3. **`next start` needs `apps/web/e2e/env.mjs`'s placeholders**, not invented ones. Hand-made values
   give *"Something went wrong."* on sign-in — Better Auth failing to construct. That file is the
   single copy of them by design; do not write a fourth.
4. **Read the existing spec before guessing a selector.** EPIC-040 lost several minutes inventing
   `.compiled-span` + "Edit" when `compiled-pane.spec.ts` had the real flow all along.
5. **When a symptom looks environmental, probe the thing.** Print the value, load the page, read the
   row. Three mysteries in three epics were each settled in under a minute that way after being
   reasoned about for much longer.

## Gates and the local loop

`pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` each report **every package** with its own verdict; paste
the table, not the word "clean". `pnpm e2e` builds, so it tests the artifact that ships, and it needs
its own Postgres:

```
docker run -d --rm --name 41p-e2e-postgres -p 55435:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=41p -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=41p -e POSTGRES_DB=41p postgres:16
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://41p:41p@127.0.0.1:55435/41p && pnpm db:migrate
```

The four visual-regression baselines are Linux-only and skip on macOS. A skip is not a pass, and the
suite says so at the end of every run.

## Housekeeping

A `STOP` file has sat in the repository root since 2026-09-14. It halts `scripts/run-epics.sh`
between and during epics; it does not affect a session a person starts by hand. Remove it when the
unattended runner should move again.
